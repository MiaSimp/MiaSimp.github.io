    <h2 class = "body-text">Introduction</h2>
    <p class = "body-text"> This tutorial utilizes the Machine Learning algorithm of Multinomial Naive Bayes to predict TV show genres based on titles and plot summaries. The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is seen mostly in Natural Language Processing and uses the Bayesâ€™ theorem to predict the category of a text. 
	    The classifier operates by calculating the probability of an object belonging to a certain category based on the probabilities of its features occurring in that category, assuming that the features of the data are independent of each other. The category with the highest calculated probability is then selected as 
	    the predicted classification for your given object. <br><br>
	    In this tutorial, we will be predicting the genre of a TV show based on the text in its title and description. TV show genres are typically manually tagged, which can be a tedious process when taking into account how many shows exist on platforms such as Hulu. Since summaries and titles hold integral information about their shows, 
	    I employed this Machine Learning algorithm to quickly classify TV show genres given their title and description.
